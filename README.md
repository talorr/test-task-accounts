# Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + PrimeVue

This is a Vue 3 project created with the [Vite Vue Plugin](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue) and configured with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) as the state management library and [PrimeVue](https://www.primevue.org/) as the UI library.

### Running

`npm run i`, then `npm run dev`

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are ignored in the `tsconfig.json` through the `include` option. If you wish to type check `.vue` imports, you can run `npm run type-check` or `npm run lint` which will do it for you. However, be aware that it might take some time depending on your project size.

### Commit Message Convention

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.

### Code Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Run `npm run format` to format your code.
